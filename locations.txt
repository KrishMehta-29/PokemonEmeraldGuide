NOTE:  When fishing on Route 119, there are 6
       tiles where Feebas can be caught.  Those
       6 tiles are random, and can be randomized
       again by resetting the "Trendy Phrase" on 
       Dewford Island.  Feebas can be caught by
       any rod at a level that corresponds with
       the level of the rod.
